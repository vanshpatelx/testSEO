            <h2>1) Contract Summary (plain-English, non-binding aid)</h2>
            <p>
              We operate a referral and lead-generation service that connects you with licensed insurance agents or specialists. We are not an insurance company and do not underwrite, bind, or sell insurance coverage.
            </p>
            <p>
              Submitting a quote request authorizes us and our partners to contact you by calls, texts, and emails. Message and data rates may apply. You can opt out of texts by replying STOP.
            </p>
            <p>
              Coverage and product availability vary by state and carrier, and no coverage is effective unless and until issued by a licensed carrier and you receive written confirmation from that carrier or the agent.
            </p>
            <p>
              We use cookies and similar technologies. Where legally required, we honor opt-out preference signals such as Global Privacy Control and provide controls for targeted advertising or sharing.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may use automated tools, including AI assistants or chatbots, for informational support. These tools are not licensed agents and their outputs may be inaccurate. They are not coverage or legal advice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Disputes are resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis with a small-claims court option.

            <p>
              By using the Site, you agree to these Terms and to our Privacy Notice, which is incorporated by reference.
